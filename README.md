📈 Week 1: Python & Trading Foundations
In Week 1, we laid the groundwork for algorithmic trading by covering Python fundamentals, stock market basics, candlestick charting, and basic probability concepts. Students also implemented their first trading strategy using Python.

📝 Submission Highlights:
Fetched 1-year NSE stock data using yfinance

Plotted interactive candlestick charts with annotated market patterns

Calculated and compared simple vs log returns

Computed rolling 14-day volatility and visualized it alongside price

Applied binomial probability to real market data to explore the probability paradox

Calculated expected value from a risk/reward scenario and supported it with simulations

📂 All tasks were submitted in a clean, well-documented Jupyter/Colab notebook with embedded plots and markdown explanations.
